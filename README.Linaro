This repository keeps Linaro's copy of Debian kernel packaging.

We did some changes compared to Debian:

- enabled several server related options on arm64
- enabled support for arm64 servers (plan to merge it upstream)
- disabled Android support
- graphics support for VMÂ instances is enabled (virtio-gpu)
